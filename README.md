# yahtzee
This is a game of Yahtzee.  This version is only designed for 1 player.  Multiple players would need more code and I just didn't want to code that much.  Feel free to copy and paste.
This is a work in progress.  It's not finished.  I'll keep updating Github, but it's a pretty simple premise.  3 rolls.  After 3 rolls you choose where you get your points.
I'm going to use some operators when they choose where they're going to place their points.  &&, ||, <, >, if, else, all that stuff.  So check it out.  See if 
you can fork it and come up with a better version of this.  I'd like to see that.  Beating me at my own game.
